# NACC Form Rules

This directory contains all NACC form-specific JSON rules (validation schemas). These are examples of JSON `schemas` that can be passed to `QualityCheck` (or more directly to `NACCValidator`). Refer to the tables below for which forms to use, and feel free to modify them for your own uses.

[Data Quality Rule Definition Guidelines](./data-quality-rule-definition-guidelines.md) provides a comprehensive guide on how the quality rules themselves work.
